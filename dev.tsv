0	How Works Diaphragm Pump	Diaphragm pump schematic .
1	How Works Diaphragm Pump	A diaphragm pump ( also known as a Membrane pump , Air Operated Double Diaphragm Pump ( AODD ) or Pneumatic Diaphragm Pump ) is a positive displacement pump that uses a combination of the reciprocating action of a rubber , thermoplastic or teflon diaphragm and suitable valves either side of the diaphragm ( check valve , butterfly valves , flap valves , or any other form of shut-off valves ) to pump a fluid .
0	How Works Diaphragm Pump	There are three main types of diaphragm pumps:
0	How Works Diaphragm Pump	Those in which the diaphragm is sealed with one side in the fluid to be pumped , and the other in air or hydraulic fluid .
0	How Works Diaphragm Pump	The diaphragm is flexed , causing the volume of the pump chamber to increase and decrease .
0	How Works Diaphragm Pump	A pair of non-return check valves prevent reverse flow of the fluid .
0	How Works Diaphragm Pump	Those employing volumetric positive displacement where the prime mover of the diaphragm is electro-mechanical , working through a crank or geared motor drive , or purely mechanical , such as with a lever or handle .
0	How Works Diaphragm Pump	This method flexes the diaphragm through simple mechanical action , and one side of the diaphragm is open to air .
0	How Works Diaphragm Pump	Those employing one or more unsealed diaphragms with the fluid to be pumped on both sides .
0	How Works Diaphragm Pump	The diaphragm ( s ) again are flexed , causing the volume to change .
0	How Works Diaphragm Pump	When the volume of a chamber of either type of pump is increased ( the diaphragm moving up ) , the pressure decreases , and fluid is drawn into the chamber .
0	How Works Diaphragm Pump	When the chamber pressure later increases from decreased volume ( the diaphragm moving down ) , the fluid previously drawn in is forced out .
0	How Works Diaphragm Pump	Finally , the diaphragm moving up once again draws fluid into the chamber , completing the cycle .
0	How Works Diaphragm Pump	This action is similar to that of the cylinder in an internal combustion engine .
